<P>Again, no rule says you cannot start a sentence with &#8220;rather.&#8221; Using &#8220;rather&#8221; at the beginning of a sentence is not very common, but you can do it (<A href="https://www.macmillandictionaryblog.com/rather-interesting" rel="noreferrer noopener" target=_blank>source</A>).</P>
<DIV></DIV>
<P>Examples:</P>
<P><STRONG><EM>Rather</EM></STRONG><EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>a disappointing experience to have worked so hard only to lose.</EM></P>
<P><STRONG><EM>Rather</EM></STRONG><EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>to live free to make your own choices than to die in chains.</EM></P>
<P><STRONG><EM>Rather</EM></STRONG><EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>than sit quietly to await her turn, the woman protested the long wait times by demanding to speak with a manager.</EM></P><SPAN class=extract>
<P>In British English, they use the one-word sentence &#8220;Rather!&#8221; to agree with something that someone else has said. This use of the word is a little outdated in today&#8217;s society, but here are a few examples of how you could use &#8220;rather&#8221; as a one-word sentence.</P>
<P></SPAN>Example 1:&nbsp;</P>
<UL>
<LI>Person 1: It is a wonderful day today! 
<LI>Person 2:<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>Rather!</STRONG></LI></UL>
<P>Example 2:&nbsp;</P>
<UL>
<LI>Person 1: That professor&#8217;s class is extremely difficult to pass. 
<LI>Person 2:<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>Rather</STRONG>.</LI></UL>
<P>&#8220;Rather,&#8221; in this context, is always a reply to a statement from someone else that you agree with. You also think that it is a wonderful day today. You agree that the professor&#8217;s class is extremely difficult to pass.&nbsp;</P>

<P>In such cases, it is grammatically correct to use &#8220;rather&#8221; as a one-word sentence (<A href="https://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/rather#rather__9" rel="noreferrer noopener" target=_blank>source</A>).
