<H3 class=sectionHead>4.9 Alternative Abstractions</H3></A><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff">Although threads are a common way to express and manage concurrency, they are not the only way. In this section, we describe two popular alternatives, each targeted at a different application domain: </FONT>
<UL class=itemize1>
<LI class=itemize>
<P><B>Asynchronous I/O and event-driven programming.</B> Asynchronous I/O and events allow a single-threaded program to cope with high-latency I/O devices by overlapping I/O with processing and other I/O. </P>
<LI class=itemize>
<P><B>Data parallel programming.</B> With data parallel programming, all processors perform the same instructions in parallel on different parts of a data set.</P></LI></UL>
<P>In each case, the goal is similar: to replace the complexities of multi-threading with a deterministic, sequential model that is easier for the programmer to understand and debug. <A id=x1-32001r56 name=x1-32001r56></A>
