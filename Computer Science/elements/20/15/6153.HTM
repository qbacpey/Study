<P>The cooperative model is similar to multiprogramming where a process executes on the CPU until making a I/O request. Cooperative user-level threads execute on the assigned kernel-level thread until they voluntarily give back the kernel thread to the thread manager.</P>
<P>In the cooperative model, threads<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>yield</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>to each other, either explicitly (e.g., by calling a<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><CODE><FONT face="Courier New">yield()</FONT></CODE><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>provided by the user-level thread library) or implicitly (e.g., requesting a lock held by another thread). In the below figure a many-to-one system with cooperative user-level threads is shown.</P>
