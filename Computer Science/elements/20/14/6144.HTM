<LI><SPAN class=headers>Title:</SPAN></B><SPAN class=RefText> Implementing threads : Kernel level threads</SPAN></FONT></LI></UL>
<P>Kernel level threads are supported and managed directly by the operating system.</P>
<UL>
<LI>The kernel knows about and manages all threads. 
<LI>One process control block (PCP) per process. 
<LI>One thread control block (TCB) per thread in the system. 
<LI>Provide system calls to create and manage threads from user space.</LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>Advantages</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI>The kernel has full knowledge of all threads. 
<LI>Scheduler may decide to give more CPU time to a process having a large numer of threads. 
<LI>Good for applications that frequently block.</LI></UL>
<P><STRONG>Disadvantages</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI>Kernel manage and schedule all threads. 
<LI>Significant overhead and increase in kernel complexity. 
<LI>Kernel level threads are slow and inefficient compared to user level threads. 
<LI>Thread operations are hundreds of times slower compared to user-level threads</LI></UL>
