Of course, we also want to be able to run user programs as well. Since many user programs are single-threaded, we start with the simple case of how to integrate kernel threads and single-threaded processes. We then turn to various ways of implementing </FONT><EM><A data-9uzdtcnnj6xqoalwmdp3qa='{"name": "OEBPS/Text/part0000.xhtml", "frag": "glo:multi-threaded process"}'>multi-threaded processes</A></EM><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff">, processes with multiple threads. All widely used modern operating systems support both kernel threads and multi-threaded processes. Both programming languages, such as Java, and standard library interfaces such as POSIX and simple threads, use this operating system support to provide the thread abstraction to the programmer. </FONT><A id=x1-28001r49 name=x1-28001r49></A>
