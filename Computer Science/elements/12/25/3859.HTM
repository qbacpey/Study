The benefit of concurrency between the processor and the I/O is two-fold: First, processors are often much faster than the I/O systems with which they interact, so keeping the processor idle during I/O would waste much of its capacity. For example, the latency to read from disk can be tens of milliseconds, enough to execute more than 10 million instructions on a modern processor. After requesting a block from disk, the operating system can switch to another program, or another thread within the same program, until the disk completes and the original thread is ready to resume.

<P>Second, I/O provides a way for the computer to interact with external entities, such as users pressing keys on a keyboard or a remote computer sending network packets. The arrival of this type of I/O event is unpredictable, so the processor must be able to work on other tasks while still responding quickly to these external events.</P>
