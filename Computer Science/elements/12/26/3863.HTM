<P></P>
<P><B>ANSWER: </B>The main thread must go into the READY&nbsp;state when it is first created; otherwise, it would never be scheduled. On a uniprocessor, it must also give up the processor (e.g., due to a time slice or in thread_join) in order for its children threads to run. The children threads could then completely run before the main thread is re-scheduled. Once the children have finished, the main thread can run to completion. Thus, <B>the minimum number of times is two</B>
