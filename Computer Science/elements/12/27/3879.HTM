<P>Although most thread systems include a scheduler that can &#8212; at least in principle &#8212; run any thread at any time, some systems provide the abstraction of <EM>cooperative threads</EM>. In these systems, a thread runs without interruption until it explicitly relinquishes control of the processor to another thread. </P>

<P>An advantage of cooperative multi-threading is increased control over the interleavings among threads. For example, in most cooperative multi-threading systems, only one thread runs at a time, so while a thread is running, no other thread can run and affect the system&#8217;s state. </P>

<P>Unfortunately, cooperative multi-threading has significant disadvantages. For example, a long-running thread can monopolize the processor, starving other threads and making the system&#8217;s user interface sluggish or non-responsive. Additionally, modern multiprocessor machines run multiple threads at a time, so one would still have to reason about the possible interactions between threads even if cooperative multi-threading were used. Thus, although cooperative multi-threading was used in some significant systems in the past, including early versions of Apple&#8217;s MacOS operating system, it is less often used today. </P><SPAN class=extract>
<P>The alternative we describe in this book is sometimes called <EM>preemptive multi-threading</EM> since running threads can be switched at any time. Whenever the book uses the term &#8220;multi-threading,&#8221; it means preemptive multi-threading unless we explicitly state otherwise.</P>
