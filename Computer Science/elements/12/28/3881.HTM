<H3>Variable names in C are just labels</H3>
<P>This point is frequently ignored by programmers who don't actually hack on compilers. <SPAN class=extract>A variable in C is just a convenient, alphanumeric pseudonym of a memory location. Were we writing assembly code, we would just create a label in some memory location and then access this label instead of always hard-coding the memory value - and this is what the compiler does.</SPAN>Well, actually the address is not hard-coded in an absolute way because of loading and relocation issues, but for the sake of this discussion we don't have to get into these details.</P>
<P>A label is something the compiler assigns<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>at compile time</EM>. From here the great difference between arrays and pointers in C stems. And this is also why&#65288;Arrays passed to functions are converted to pointers&#65289;
