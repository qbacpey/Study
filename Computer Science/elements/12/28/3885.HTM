<P><SPAN class=extract>The word surely can fill in for definitely or absolutely. It comes in handy especially when you're surprised that anyone would doubt what you're saying: "I can't believe the school banned that book. Surely kids should have access to classic literature." </SPAN>Surely comes from the same roots as sure, from the Old French seur, "secure, undoubted, or dependable," and the Latin securus, "free from care, untroubled, or safe."
