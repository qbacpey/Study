A good way to understand the simple threads API is that it provides a way to invoke an <EM><A data-9uzdtcnnj6xqoalwmdp3qa='{"name": "OEBPS/Text/part0000.xhtml", "frag": "glo:asynchronous procedure call"}'>asynchronous procedure call</A></EM>. A normal procedure call passes a set of arguments to a function, runs the function immediately on the caller&#8217;s stack, and when the function is completed, returns control back to the caller with the result. An asynchronous procedure call separates the call from the return: with thread_create, the caller starts the function, but unlike a normal procedure call, the caller continues execution concurrently with the called function. Later, the caller can wait for the function completion (with thread_join).
