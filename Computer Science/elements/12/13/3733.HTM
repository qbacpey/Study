<P>&#8220;Rather than&#8221; is one of the very few ways you can start a stand-alone sentence with &#8220;rather.&#8221; Serving in a coordinating conjunction-type role in a sentence or as a prepositional phrase, &#8220;Rather than&#8221; coordinates contrasting or comparative verbs (<A href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/grammar/british-grammar/rather" rel="noreferrer noopener" target=_blank>source</A>).&nbsp;<FIGURE class="aligncenter is-resized"><FIGCAPTION></FIGCAPTION></FIGURE></P>
<P>As a coordinating conjunction, &#8220;rather than&#8221; serves its purpose in the middle of the sentence, bringing the independent clause together with the dependent one.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Examples:</P>
<P><EM>Against his parents&#8217; wishes, Damon wanted to become a musician<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></EM><STRONG><EM>rather than</EM></STRONG><EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>a teacher.</EM></P>
<P><EM>The woman gave birth to a girl<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></EM><STRONG><EM>rather than</EM></STRONG><EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>the boy she had expected.</EM></P>
<P><EM>The cat jumped out the window and landed on its back<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></EM><STRONG><EM>rather than</EM></STRONG><EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>its feet.&nbsp;</EM></P>
<P>In all of these examples, &#8220;rather than&#8221; is the glue that brings contrasting, subordinate sentences together into one cohesive thought.</P>

<P>When you start a sentence with &#8220;rather than,&#8221; you suggest that one verb in the sentence is replacing another. Using &#8220;rather than&#8221; as a prepositional phrase in this way helps to bring together two contrasting dependent or subordinate sentences, clauses, or words (<A href="https://www.opentextbooks.org.hk/ditatopic/4537" rel="noreferrer noopener" target=_blank>source</A>).</P>
<P>Examples:</P>
<P><STRONG><EM>Rather than</EM></STRONG><EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>swimming to the other side of the lake, Judy decided to take the rowboat.</EM></P>
<P><STRONG><EM>Rather than</EM></STRONG><EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>going to the movies with his friends, Micheal stayed home and finished his research paper for history class.</EM></P>
<P><STRONG><EM>Rather than</EM></STRONG><EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>going over to his mother&#8217;s house for a visit, James picked up the phone and called her instead.</EM></P><SPAN class=extract>
<P>Notice that when you use &#8220;rather than&#8221; as a prepositional phrase, the verb that follows &#8220;rather than&#8221; is almost always in -ing form (when it doesn&#8217;t take the plain form), whereas the verb that contrasts in the latter part of the sentence is usually in the past tense.&nbsp;</P>
<P>-ing form:<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>Rather than</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>dancing</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>with her friends on the dance floor, Rebecca<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>stood</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>near the wall with a drink in her hand.</P>
<P>Plain form:<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>Rather than dance</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>with her friends on the dance floor, Rebecca<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>stood</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>near the wall with a drink in her hand.</P>
<P></SPAN>Also, like using the preposition &#8220;instead of,&#8221; when starting a sentence with the prepositional version of &#8220;rather than,&#8221; the verbs in the dependent sentences &#8212; dependent meaning unable to stand alone &#8212; are not comparable.
