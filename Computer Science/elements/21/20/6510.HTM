<P>You can think I/O processor along the lines of DMA approach.<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>The I/O processor, generally used in large computer systems, is a coprocessor which is capable of executing the instructions in addition to transfer of data.</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>By the way, the coprocessor instruction system is different from the CPU.
