<P></P>
<P></<BR><SPAN class=extract>In<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="https://www.imperva.com/learn/performance/anycast/">anycast</A>, a collection of servers share the same IP address and send data from a source computer to the server that is topographically the closest.</SPAN> This helps cut down on latency and bandwidth costs, improves load time for users, and improves availability. It is important to remember that topographically closer does not inherently mean geographically closer, though this is often the case.</P><SPAN class=extract>
<P>Anycast is linked with the BGP protocol which ensures that all of a router&#8217;s neighbors are aware of the networks that can be reached through that router and the topographical distance to those networks. The main principle of anycast is that an IP address range is advertised in the BGP messages of multiple routers. As this propagates across the Internet, routers become aware of which of their neighbors provides the shortest topographical path to the advertised IP address.</P>
