<P>Describe where the data for<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><VAR>symbol</VAR><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>is stored. For a register variable, this says which register it is kept in. For a non-register local variable, this prints the stack-frame offset at which the variable is always stored.</P>
<P>Note the contrast with &#8216;<SAMP>print &amp;<VAR>symbol</VAR></SAMP>&#8217;, which does not work at all for a register variable, and for a stack local variable prints the exact address of the current instantiation of the variable.</P></DD>
