<H1><FONT size=6><SPAN class=headers>Title:</SPAN></B><SPAN class=RefText> Could have, should have, would have : The Third Conditional</SPAN></FONT></H1>
<P>We make the third conditional by using the<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/past-perfect.html">past perfect</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>after 'if' and then 'would have' and the<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/irregular-verbs.html">past participle</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>in the second part of the sentence:</P>
<UL>
<LI>if + past perfect, ...would + have + past participle</LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P>It talks about the past. It's used to describe a situation that didn't happen, and to imagine the result of this situation.</P>
