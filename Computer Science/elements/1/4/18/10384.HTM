I would have gone to the party, but I was really busy. 
<P>(= I wanted to go to the party, but I didn't because I was busy. If I hadn't been so busy, I would have gone to the party.)&#65306;we can also use<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><B>would have + past participle</B><SPAN><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>to talk about something you wanted to do but didn't. This is very similar to the third conditional, but we don't need an 'if clause'</SPAN>
