<P>I would have called you, but I didn't know your number. </P>
<P>(= I wanted to call you but I didn't know your number, so I didn't call you.)&#65306;</P>

<P>we can also use<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><B>would have + past participle</B><SPAN><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>to talk about something you wanted to do but didn't. This is very similar to the third conditional, but we don't need an 'if clause'</SPAN>
