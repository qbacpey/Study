<SPAN class=extract>When the kernel starts running, it can initialize its data structures</SPAN>, <SPAN class=extract>including setting up the interrupt vector table to point to the various interrupt, processor exception, and system call handlers</SPAN>. <SPAN class=extract>The kernel then starts the first process, typically the user login page</SPAN>. To run this process, the operating system reads the code for the login program from its disk location, and jumps to the first instruction in the program, using the start process procedure described above. The login process in turn can trap into the kernel using a system call whenever it needs the kernel&#8217;s services, e.g., to render the login prompt on the screen. We discuss the system calls needed for processes to do useful work in Chapter&nbsp;<A data-ixbpernmnjoud4qz9ktzkg='{"name": "OEBPS/Text/part0000.xhtml", "frag": "x1-540003"}'>3</A>
