Issuing a<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><KBD>ptype /o struct tuv</KBD><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>command would print:</P>
<DIV class=smallexample><PRE class=smallexample>(gdb) ptype /o struct tuv
/* offset      |    size */  type = struct tuv {
/*      0      |       4 */    int a1;

/*      8      |       8 */    char *a2;

                               /* total size (bytes):   24 */

<P>Notice the format of the first column of comments. There, you can find two parts separated by the &#8216;<SAMP>|</SAMP>&#8217; character: the<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>offset</EM>, which indicates where the field is located inside the struct, in bytes, and the<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>size</EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>of the field. Another interesting line is the marker of a<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>hole</EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>in the struct, indicating that it may be possible to pack the struct and make it use less space by reorganizing its fields.
