<P>I would have gone to the party, but I was really busy. </P>

<P>we can also use<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><B>would have + past participle</B><SPAN><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>to talk about something you wanted to do but didn't. This is very similar to the third conditional, but we don't need an 'if clause'</SPAN>
