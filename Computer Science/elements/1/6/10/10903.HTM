<SPAN>We can also use<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN><B>should have + past participle</B><SPAN><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>to talk about something that, if everything is normal and okay, we think has already happened. But we're not certain that everything is fine, so we use 'should have' and not the present perfect or past simple. It's often used with 'by now'.</SPAN>
