Instead, the BIOS provides a level of indirection, as illustrated in Figure 2.18. <SPAN class=extract>The BIOS reads a fixed-size block of bytes from a fixed position on disk (or flash RAM) into memory</SPAN>. This block of bytes is called the bootloader. <SPAN class=extract>Once the BIOS has copied the bootloader into memory, it jumps to the first instruction in the block. On some newer machines, the BIOS also checks that the bootloader has not been corrupted by a computer virus</SPAN>. (If a virus could change the bootloader and get the BIOS to jump to it, the virus would then be in control of the machine.) <SPAN class=extract>As a check, the bootloader is stored with a cryptographic signature</SPAN>, a specially designed function of the bytes in a file and a private cryptographic key that allows someone with the corresponding public key to verify that an authorized entity produced the file. It is computationally intractable for an attacker without the private key to create a different file with a valid signature. The BIOS checks that the bootloader code matches the signature, verifying its authenticity
