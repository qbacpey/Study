<P>With Unicast,<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="https://www.imperva.com/blog/dns-humans-making-sense-domain-name-system/" rel=noopener target=_blank>DNS</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>client resolvers can be configured with multiple DNS name server targets. In the event the resolver doesn&#8217;t receive any response from the first server on the list, it will typically wait a time out value, before it switches to the second server (and subsequent servers) in the resolver list. The next time the resolver has to perform a look up, it won&#8217;t &#8220;remember&#8221; servers in the list were non-responsive, and it will start querying with the first server in the list even though it is still unavailable.&nbsp; Depending on the operating system of the client, it could be one to five seconds as it rotates through the resolver list each time, attempting&nbsp;the failed server.</P>
<P>DNS client resolvers configured with anycast addresses virtually eliminate this latency, since the resolution is handled by the routing protocol. In the diagram below a single DNS client workstation, configured with the anycast DNS IP address of 123.10.10.10,&nbsp;is shown performing DNS resolution against its closest of three DNS name servers deployed using the same anycast IP address.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The client&#8217;s DNS resolver can resolve against any one of the three DNS servers shown above. Layer 3 routing&nbsp;would send our DNS client&#8217;s packets through router R1 due to the routing topology.&nbsp; Should router R1 or&nbsp;Server A fail, our DNS client&#8217;s packets would automatically be rerouted to the next nearest DNS server via routers R2 and R3.&nbsp; Additionally, the route to our server A, would be removed from the routing tables, thus preventing further use of that name server.&nbsp; Server A won&#8217;t be used until it is restored and the IP anycast address routes reinjected to the network.</P>
<P>Let&#8217;s draw an analogy from everyday life to make all of this a bit more understandable.</P>
<P>Imagine the shoes you&#8217;ve wanted are on sale and are available at all branches of a department store chain. Just like in anycast, you can be serviced at many identical sites, with no reason to prefer any specific site. So you enter &#8220;Marks and Spencer&#8221; into Waze, and the navigator will take you the nearest available branch to purchase those shoes. If the road to the nearest branch is blocked, Waze will take you to the next nearest branch.</P>&lt;
