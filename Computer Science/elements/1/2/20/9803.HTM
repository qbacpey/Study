<P>These other primary addressing methods are available to route traffic.</P>

<LI><STRONG>Unicast&nbsp;</STRONG><STRONG>addressing</STRONG>&nbsp;uses a&nbsp;<EM>one-to-one</EM>&nbsp;association, where each destination address is uniquely identified as a single receiver endpoint. Traditional DNS deployments are configured with unicast addresses.<img class="aligncenter wp-image-5582 size-full lazyloaded" src="https://www.imperva.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/anycast-1.png" width=273 height=92 data-wp-pid="5582" data-src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/anycast-1.png" loading="lazy"> 
<LI><STRONG>Multicast&nbsp;addressing</STRONG>&nbsp;uses a&nbsp;<EM>one-to-unique many&nbsp;</EM>association, where datagrams are routed from a single sender to multiple selected endpoints in a single transmission, using a multicast group address. A common use of multicast is streaming audio, where the audio is published via multicast addressing and clients pick up the routed stream as a channel.<img class="aligncenter wp-image-5583 size-full lazyloaded" src="https://www.imperva.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/anycast-2.png" width=262 height=108 data-wp-pid="5583" data-src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/anycast-2.png" loading="lazy"> 
<LI><STRONG>Broadcast&nbsp;addressing</STRONG>&nbsp;uses a&nbsp;<EM>one-to-many&nbsp;</EM>association, where datagrams are routed from a single sender to all other connected endpoints in a single transmission, using a broadcast address. The network automatically replicates datagrams as needed for all network segments (links) that contain an eligible receiver.<img class="aligncenter wp-image-5584 size-full lazyloaded" src="https://www.imperva.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/anycast-3.png" width=242 height=117 data-wp-pid="5584" data-src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/anycast-3.png" loading="lazy"></LI></UL>&lt;
