<P>The question, you might be asking, is why use anycast routing instead of the simpler unicast routing, which will get your request to that same IP address.</P>
<P>Unicast routing is certainly adequate and appropriate for a site with a single web server to accommodate a moderate amount of traffic. Imagine you are sitting with your computer at a caf&#233; on the Canal Grande and accessing www.venicegazette.com, which has 843 hits an hour. That site will have one web server and your request will quickly be routed to that Unicast address.</P>
<P>However it will not be so simple when you next access www.dailyplanet.com to read Lois Lane&#8217;s latest article. Since that paper has millions of subscribers, there are multiple web servers each with the same IP address, dispersed geographically, to serve requests.</P>

<P>The advantages of anycast in such a scenario are:</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Performance improvement</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>&#8212; Traffic is routed with negligible latency to the user as discussed above 
<LI><STRONG>Service reliability</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>&#8211; With redundant servers, the service is more highly available. For example, if the Paris server is under maintenance, service will automatically be routed to an available server with the next best route.<img class="aligncenter wp-image-5601 size-full lazyloaded" src="https://www.imperva.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/anycast-6.jpg" width=778 height=349 data-wp-pid="5601" data-src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/02/anycast-6.jpg" loading="lazy"> 
<LI><STRONG>Load balancing</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>&#8211; Routing to multiple servers will effectively balance load among the servers, improving site speed 
<LI><STRONG>Reduces impact of DoS attacks</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>&#8211; The denial of service attack will likely be localized to a server and therefore not impact the entire service</LI></UL>
