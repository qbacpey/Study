<P><STRONG>The I/O processor solves two problems:</STRONG></P>
<UL>
<LI>The job of input and output is assumed by the CPU. Although DMA does not require CPU for data exchange between peripherals and memory, it only reduces the burden of CPU. Because in DMA, the initialization of input and output is still done by CPU. 
<LI>The problem of sharing DMA interface of high speed equipment in large computer system. A large computer system peripherals so much that it had to share the DMA interface Limited (small computer systems such as PC in each device is assigned a DMA high speed interface).</LI></UL>
