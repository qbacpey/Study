Figure 4.16: An asynchronous file read on Linux. The application calls aio_read to start the read; this system call returns immediately after the disk read is initialized. The application may then do other processing while the disk is completing the requested operation. The disk interrupts the processor when the operation is complete; this causes the kernel disk interrupt handler to run. The application at any time may ask the kernel if the results of the disk read are available, and then retrieve them with aio_return.</P>

<P>An example use of asynchronous I/O is to overlap reading from disk with other computation in the same process. Reading from disk can take tens of milliseconds. In Linux, rather than issuing a read system call that blocks until the requested data has been read from disk, a process can issue an aio_read (asynchronous I/O read) system call; this call tells the operating system to initiate the read from disk and then to immediately return. Later, the process can call aio_error to determine if the disk read has finished and aio_return to retrieve the read&#8217;s results, as shown in Figure 4.16.<BR><B
