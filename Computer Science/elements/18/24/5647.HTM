<P class="q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start"><SPAN>There are some really surprisingly wrong answers to this question...so I thought I would throw in my, hopefully, _much_ more correct answer. :) And a little background.</SPAN></P>
<P class="q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start"><SPAN>All of the mentioned devices are part of a computer network....As a network is a way for computers to exchange information with multiple other computers... Obviously they have to talk the same language in some way or another. There have been many types of network cabling and technologies&#8230; but now the standard in homes and businesses are Ethernet over CAT5/6 cable with an RJ-45 connector at the end. (like a larger 8 pin version of a phone connector) Ethernet is what computers on a Local Area Network (LAN) use to talk, but on top of Ethernet, modern computers run TCP/IP which is the language of internet networking.</SPAN></P>

<P class="q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start"><SPAN>So, a NIC (Network Interface Card) or network card or adapter is a device plugged in or integrated with a computer. This hardware connects the computer to the network. A typical NIC nowadays is Ethernet, usually 1Gb/s though both slower and faster versions exist. Previously it was often a separate card that got installed in ones computer but now it is typically a chip and port that is actually part of the motherboard of the computer/laptop. A device that lets a computer connect to the wireless network can also be called a NIC or WNIC. Every Ethernet NIC has a unique MAC address given by the manufacturer so it can identify itself on the local network.</SPAN></P>

<P class="q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start"><SPAN>The way computers with NICs talk to each other is to plug into a network switch or hub that has multiple ports and this device passes the traffic to all the clients. Hubs were the first way of doing this and the traffic from all the ports was shared to every port (causing increased traffic as more devices were added), a switch is a smarter device that shares the traffic across all the ports but learns which NIC/MAC addresses are on each port and only sends the traffic for that NIC/computer to that port. Many years ago switches became cheap enough to replace hubs everywhere. You can connect multiple switches together to make larger Local networks.</SPAN></P>
<P class="q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start"><SPAN>A modem (which comes from modulator/demodulator) is a device that originally took the digital signals from a computer and enabled them to be sent over a voice line where a modem on the other side changed them back to digital signals. But people call the device that hooks their local network to their ISP a modem even when no voice line is involved. ie a cable modem.</SPAN></P>
<P class="q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start"><SPAN>A router (unsurprisingly) routes traffic between different networks. It can have many different type of interfaces. Ethernet RJ45 ports or coax or serial, etc. It looks at the address of the packet and forwards it out the correct port to the next router in the path or to the local computer if the destination is local.</SPAN></P>
<P class="q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start"><SPAN>FYI...A typical home router is an edge router and it knows about the addresses on your network and forwards everything else to your internet provider. Their routers have to make more choices to direct your packet across the right path to get to its destination. Interestingly one of the pieces that makes the internet work as well as it does is there are multiple paths to and from each destination.</SPAN></P>
<P class="q-text qu-display--block qu-wordBreak--break-word qu-textAlign--start"><SPAN>A typical ISP will provide a home with a device that may be called a modem but is actually a router/switch/Wireless access point/firewall. It lets your local computers talk to each other, it routes traffic to/from the internet, it connects your wireless devices and the firewall part lets all your connections go out but only ones come back that you initiated.</SPAN></P></SPAN>
