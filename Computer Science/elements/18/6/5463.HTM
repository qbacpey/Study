<H4 class=subsectionHead><SPAN class=headers>Title:</SPAN></B><SPAN class=RefText> 4.9.2 Data Parallel Programming</SPAN></FONT></H4>Another important application area is parallel computing, and there is an ongoing debate as to the effectiveness of threads versus other models for expressing and managing parallelism. 
<P><SPAN class=extract>One popular model is <EM><A data-9uzdtcnnj6xqoalwmdp3qa='{"name": "OEBPS/Text/part0000.xhtml", "frag": "glo:data parallel programming"}'>data parallel programming</A></EM>, also known as SIMD (single instruction multiple data) programming or <EM><A data-9uzdtcnnj6xqoalwmdp3qa='{"name": "OEBPS/Text/part0000.xhtml", "frag": "glo:bulk synchronous parallel programming"}'>bulk synchronous parallel programming</A></EM>. In this model, the programmer describes a computation to apply in parallel across an entire data set at the same time, operating on independent data elements.</SPAN> The work on every data item must complete before moving onto the next step; one processor can use the results of a different processor only in some later step. As a result, the behavior of the program is deterministic. Rather than having programmers divide work among threads, the runtime system decides how to map the parallel work across the hardware&#8217;s processors. </P>
<P>For example, taking the earlier example of zeroing a buffer in parallel in Figure&nbsp;<A data-9uzdtcnnj6xqoalwmdp3qa='{"name": "OEBPS/Text/part0000.xhtml", "frag": "x1-180017"}'>4.7</A>, a data parallel program to zero an N item array can be as simple as: </P>
<P><BR></P><PRE class=code>   &nbsp;forall&nbsp;i&nbsp;in&nbsp;0:N-1
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;array[i]&nbsp;=&nbsp;0;</PRE><BR>
<P>The runtime system would divide the array among processors to execute the computation in parallel. Of course, the runtime system itself might be implemented using threads, but this is invisible to the programmer. </P>
<P>Large data-analysis tasks often use data parallel programming. For example, Hadoop is an open source system that can process and analyze terabytes of data spread across hundreds or thousands of servers. It applies an arbitrary computation to each data element, such as to update the popularity of a web page based on a previous estimate of the popularity of the pages that refer to it. Hadoop applies the computation in parallel across all web pages, repeatedly, until the popularity of every page has converged. A search engine can then use the results to decide which pages should be returned in response to a search query. </P>
<P>Another example is SQL (Structured Query Language). SQL is a standard language for accessing databases in which programmers specify the database query to perform, and the database maps the query to lower-level thread and disk operations. </P>
<P>Multimedia streams (e.g., audio, video, and graphics) often have large amounts of data on which similar operations are repeatedly performed, so data parallel programming is frequently used for media processing; specialized hardware to support this type of parallel processing is common. Because they are optimized for highly structured data parallel programs, GPUs (Graphical Processing Units) can provide significantly higher rates of data processing. For example, in 2013 a mid-range Radeon 7850 GPU was capable of 1.69 TFLOPS (Trillion FLoating point Operations Per Second (double-precision)); for comparison, an Intel i7 3960 CPU (a high-end, six core general-purpose processor) was capable of 0.19 double-precision TFLOPS. </P>
<P>Considerable effort is currently going towards developing and using General Purpose GPUs (GPGPUs) &#8212; GPUs that better support a wider-range of programs. It is still not clear which classes of programs can work well with GPGPUs and which require more traditional CPU architectures, but for those programs that can be ported to the more restrictive GPGPU programming model, performance gains could be dramatic. <A id=x1-35001r57 name=x1-35001r57></A></P><A id=x1-3600010 name=x1-3600010>
