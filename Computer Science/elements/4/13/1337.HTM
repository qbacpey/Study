<P><SPAN class=extract>In computer science, hierarchical protection domains,[1][2] often called protection rings, are mechanisms to protect data and functionality from faults (by improving fault tolerance) and malicious behavior (by providing computer security</SPAN>).</P>
<P><SPAN class=extract>Computer operating systems provide different levels of access to resources. <SPAN class=extract>A protection ring is one of two or more hierarchical levels or layers of privilege within the architecture of a computer system</SPAN></SPAN>. <SPAN class=extract>This is generally hardware-enforced by some CPU architectures that provide different CPU modes at the hardware or microcode level</SPAN>. Rings are arranged in a hierarchy from most privileged (most trusted, usually numbered zero) to least privileged (least trusted, usually with the highest ring number). <SPAN class=extract>On most operating systems, Ring 0 is the level with the most privileges and interacts most directly with the physical hardware such as the CPU and memory</SPAN>.
