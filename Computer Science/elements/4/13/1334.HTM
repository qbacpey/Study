<P><SPAN class=extract>In computing, preemption is the act of temporarily interrupting an executing task, with the intention of resuming it at a later time</SPAN>. <SPAN class=extract>This interrupt is done by an external scheduler with no assistance or cooperation from the task</SPAN>.[1]:&#8202;153&#8202; This <SPAN class=extract>preemptive scheduler usually runs in the most privileged protection ring, meaning that interruption and resuming are considered highly secure actions.</SPAN> Such a change in the currently executing task of a processor is known as context switching.
