<B><SPAN class=extract><B>Transfer control to user mode</B></SPAN>.</B> When a new process starts, there is no saved state to restore. <SPAN class=extract>While it would be possible to write special code for this case, most operating systems re-use the same code to exit the kernel for starting a new process and for returning from a system call</SPAN>. When we create the new process, we allocate a kernel stack to it, and we reserve room at the bottom of the kernel stack for the initial values of its user-space registers, program counter, stack pointer, and processor status word. <SPAN class=extract>To start the new program, we can then switch to the new stack and jump to the end of the interrupt handler. When the handler executes popad and iret, the processor &#8220;returns&#8221; to the start of the user program</SPAN>
