This is a graphical explanation: 
<P></P><img src="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/images/2009/10/array_place.png"> 
<P>The rightmost column is the memory addresses, and the boxes are the contents of memory cells. The first few letters of the string in<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><TT class="docutils literal"><SPAN class=pre>array_place</SPAN></TT><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>are displayed.</P>
<P><SPAN class=extract>Note that<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><TT class="docutils literal"><SPAN class=pre>array_place</SPAN></TT><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>is simply a label (or an alias) to the memory address 0x417000. Therefore accessing<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><TT class="docutils literal"><SPAN class=pre>array_place[7]</SPAN></TT><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>is simply accessing memory address 0x417007. Therefore, as we can see in the disassembly, the compiler just replaces<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><TT class="docutils literal"><SPAN class=pre>array_place[7]</SPAN></TT><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>by 0x417007 - no address computation has to be done by the assembly it generates</SPAN>.
