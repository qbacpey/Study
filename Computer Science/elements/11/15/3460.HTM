<SPAN class=extract>Something that's <SPAN class=headers>Title:</SPAN></B><SPAN class=RefText> defective</SPAN></FONT>doesn't work quite right, because it's damaged in some way. Your defective car probably won't make it all the way to California from New York. </SPAN>

<P>Defective things are broken or flawed. <SPAN class=extract>A defective blender won't mix your morning smoothie the way you want it to</SPAN>, and <SPAN class=extract>a defective law doesn't serve the people it's meant to protect</SPAN>. A very old-fashioned meaning of defective, which is considered quite offensive today, is "mentally ill" or "mentally handicapped." The Late Latin root is defectivus, "to fail, revolt, or desert."
