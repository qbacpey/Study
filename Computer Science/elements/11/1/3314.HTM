<strong><font color="blue">Can You Start a Sentence With &#8220;Rather&#8221;? : </font></strong><h4 id=using-instead-of>Using &#8220;Instead Of&#8221;</H4>
<P>If we replace &#8220;rather than&#8221; in the above example sentences with &#8220;instead of,&#8221; the meaning of the sentence changes very little, but the tone may become brasher (<A href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/usage-of-rather-than" rel="noreferrer noopener" target=_blank>source</A>).&nbsp;</P>
<P>Examples:</P>
<P><STRONG><EM>Instead of</EM></STRONG><EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>swimming to the other side of the lake, Judy decided to take the rowboat.&nbsp;</EM></P>
<P><STRONG><EM>Instead of</EM></STRONG><EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>going to the movies with his friends, Micheal stayed home and finished his research paper for History class.</EM></P>
<P><STRONG><EM>Instead of<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></EM></STRONG><EM>going over to his mother&#8217;s house for a visit, James picked up the phone and called her instead.</EM></P>
<P><STRONG><EM>Instead of</EM></STRONG><EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>dancing with her friends on the dance floor, Rebecca stood near the wall with a drink in her hand.</EM></P>
<H3 id=can-you-start-a-question-with-rather>Can You Start a Question With &#8220;Rather&#8221;?</H3>
<P>Although you would not do this regularly in American English,&nbsp;you can use &#8220;rather than&#8221; in a prepositional sentence structure to form a compound question with &#8220;rather&#8221; at the start of the sentence.</P>
<P>Examples:</P>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Rather than</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>going to a movie, do you want to get tickets for the baseball game? 
<LI><STRONG>Rather than</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>eating tacos tonight, what do you think about going out for sushi? 
<LI><STRONG>Rather than</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>just sitting there watching me clean the house, do you mind helping me?</LI></UL>
<P>In these examples, notice that the speaker, or question asker, is stating what is or would be and giving the listener another alternative in the form of a question.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Also, notice that the verb in the latter part of the sentence is now in the present tense, plain form, while the verb after &#8220;rather than&#8221; in the first part of the sentence remains in -ing form.</P>
<P>Example:&nbsp;</P>
<P><STRONG><EM>Rather than</EM></STRONG><EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>getting some donuts for dessert, do you<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></EM><STRONG><EM>want to get</EM></STRONG><EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>some frozen yogurt from the new shop that just opened?</EM>
