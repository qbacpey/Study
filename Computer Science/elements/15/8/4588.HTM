<P>Scarce, meaning &#8220;restricted in quantity,&#8221; can oddly be traced back to the same Latin word that spawned the word "excerpt." <SPAN class=extract>Use the word scarce when you want to say that something is hard to find or practically missing.</SPAN> <SPAN class=extract>When you know you&#8217;re about to be asked to do something unpleasant, like wash the dishes or take out the trash, go ahead and &#8220;make yourself scarce,&#8221; which means to be elusive or get out of there fast.</SPAN>
