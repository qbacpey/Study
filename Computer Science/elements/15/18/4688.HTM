<P><SPAN class=extract>The verb agitate means "to shake up." So someone who is agitated has been shaken up by something &#8212; disturbing news, a careless driver who nearly caused a huge accident, or just a very long, very bad day.</SPAN> <SPAN class=extract>Agitated can also describe being activated, or fired up about something. For example, a political cause might be losing steam until an event like a rally gets everyone agitated all over again.</SPAN>
