<P>How to get a handle on the word handle? Start with the thumb. Much like the word &#8220;thimble&#8221; is derived from &#8220;thumb,&#8221; &#8220;handle&#8221; essentially refers to an object held "in hand," or placed under your control. <SPAN class=extract>Handle can also have a more abstract meaning, such as understanding or grasping a concept. You should be able to handle geometry before you start trig, right? </SPAN><SPAN class=extract>A handle is also slang for a nickname.
