All code that runs in kernel mode shares a single<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/gettingstarted/virtual-address-spaces" data-linktype="relative-path">virtual address space</A>. This means that a kernel-mode driver is not isolated from other drivers and the operating system itself. If a kernel-mode driver accidentally writes to the wrong virtual address, data that belongs to the operating system or another driver could be compromised. If a kernel-mode driver crashes, the entire operating system crashes.
