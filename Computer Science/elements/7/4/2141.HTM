<P>You can make a self-correction by using the phrase &#8220;or rather&#8221; after a comma or in its own separate sentence (<A href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rather">source</A>).</P>
<P>Examples:</P>
<P><EM>&nbsp;Adam was embarrassed<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></EM><STRONG><EM>or rather</EM></STRONG><EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>shy about his singing voice, so he had terrible stage fright.</EM></P>
<P><EM>The thief admitted to stealing the car.<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></EM><STRONG><EM>Or rather</EM></STRONG><EM>, he admitted to borrowing the car but refuses to say if he was going to return it.</EM></P>
<P><EM>Taunya took a shortcut down a small street,<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></EM><STRONG><EM>or rather</EM></STRONG><EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>an alleyway, to get to her home.</EM></P>
<P></SPAN>Notice that the latter part of the sentence corrects the former portion, which generally has stronger or broader wording than the correcting phrase.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Example:&nbsp;</P>
<P><EM>Tyson wanted to be a<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></EM><STRONG><EM>Doctor</EM></STRONG><EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>when he grew up.<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></EM><STRONG><EM>Or rather</EM></STRONG><EM>, he wanted to be a<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></EM><STRONG><EM>Pediatrician</EM></STRONG><EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>because he loved children.</EM></P>
<P>You can use &#8220;rather&#8221; to provide contrast from the first part of the sentence to the second, much like the use of the word &#8220;instead.&#8221; Only when you use &#8220;rather,&#8221; it softens the contrast between the two thoughts and lightens the tone, if only a little.</P>
<P>Examples:&nbsp;</P>
<P><EM>Tim didn&#8217;t like to get beef from the big-name grocery store down the street;<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></EM><STRONG><EM>rather,</EM></STRONG><EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>he preferred to go to his local butcher shop.</EM></P>
<P><EM>Jessie never liked driving just two miles to work;<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></EM><STRONG><EM>rather,</EM></STRONG><EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>she enjoyed riding her bike and watching the sunrise.</EM></P>
<P><EM>My grandmother would never text me to ask a simple question;<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></EM><STRONG><EM>rather,</EM></STRONG><EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>she would call me and have a long conversation.</EM></P>

<P>In these examples, you use &#8220;rather&#8221; to indicate the preference of the subject. For example, Jessie prefers biking to work, while Tim prefers to get his beef from the local butcher shop. Finally, grandma prefers to call.
