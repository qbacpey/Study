<DIV align=left>&nbsp;Executable files are stored in a defined format on the disk, different operating systems may have different definitions for the actual format but there are generally common elements in the way they are stored. A format commonly used on Unix systems such as Linux is called Extensible Linked Format (ELF). <SPAN class=extract>An ELF programme consists of an ELF header, a program header table, a number of sections and an optional section header table. The header contains all the information the kernel needs to create a process image (i.e. load the programme into memory and allocate resources to prepare it for execution)</SPAN>.</DIV>
<DIV align=left><SPAN class=extract>Programme code on a multitasking operating system must be re-entrant. This means it can be shared by multiple processes. To be re-entrant the code must not modify itself at any time and the data must be stored separately from the instruction text (such that each independent process can maintain its own data space)</SPAN>.</DIV>
<DIV align=left>&nbsp;When a programme is loaded as a process it is allocated a section of virtual memory which forms its useable address space. Within this process image there are typically at least four elements :</DIV>
