A molecule is the simplest structural unit of a substance that still keeps the properties of that substance, like a molecule of water. <SPAN class=extract>This scientific word also gets used in unscientific ways, as in "Every single moleculein my body wants that chocolate cupcake!"</SPAN>

<P><SPAN class=extract>People sometimes confuse molecules with atoms, but a molecule is made up of atoms.</SPAN> A molecule retains the characteristic of the substance it&#8217;s from, so a water molecule is still water. An atom only has the characteristics of its element, not the larger composition. For example, a water molecule, H2O, is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
