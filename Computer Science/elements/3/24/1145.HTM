<P>This section holds strings, most commonly the strings that represent the names associated with symbol table entries. If a file has a loadable segment that includes the symbol string table, the section's attributes will include the SHF_ALLOC bit; otherwise, that bit will be off.</P>
<P><SPAN class=extract>This section describes the default string table</SPAN>. <SPAN class=extract>String table sections hold null-terminated character sequences, commonly called strings</SPAN>. <SPAN class=extract>The object file uses these strings to represent symbol and section names</SPAN>. <SPAN class=extract>One references a string as an index into the string table section</SPAN>. 
<P><SPAN class=extract>The first byte, which is index zero, is defined to hold a null character</SPAN>. <SPAN class=extract>Likewise, a string table's last byte is defined to hold a null character, ensuring null termination for all strings</SPAN>. <SPAN class=extract>A string whose index is zero specifies either no name or a null name, depending on the context</SPAN>. <SPAN class=extract>An empty string table section is permitted; its section header's sh_size member would contain zero</SPAN>. Non-zero indexes are invalid for an empty string table. 
<P><SPAN class=extract>A section header's&nbsp; sh_name member holds an index into the section header string table section, as designated by the e_shstrndx member of the ELF header</SPAN>. The following figures show a string table with 25 bytes and the strings associated with various indexes. 
<P><SPAN class=extract>As the example shows, a string table index may refer to any byte in the section. A string may appear more than once; references to substrings may exist; and a single string may be referenced multiple times. Unreferenced strings also are allowed</SPAN>.
