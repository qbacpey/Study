<H3 class=sectionHead><SPAN class=headers>Title:</SPAN></B><SPAN class=RefText> 2.11 Summary and Future Directions</SPAN></FONT></H3></A><FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff">The process concept &#8212; the ability to execute arbitrary user programs with restricted rights &#8212; has been remarkably successful. With the exception of devices that run only a single application at a time (such as embedded systems and game consoles), every commercially successful operating system provides process isolation. </FONT>
<P>The reason for this success is obvious. Without process isolation, computer systems would be much more fragile and less secure. As recently as a decade ago, it was common for personal computers to crash on a daily basis. Today, laptops can remain working for weeks at a time without rebooting. This has occurred even though the operating system and application software on these systems have become more complex. While some of the improvement is due to better hardware reliability and automated bug tracking, process isolation has been a key technology in constructing more reliable system software. </P>
<P>Process isolation is also essential to building more secure computer systems. Without isolation, computer users would be forced to trust every application loaded onto the computer, not just the operating system code. In practice, however, complete process isolation remains more an aspiration than a reality. Most operating systems are vulnerable to malicious applications because the attacker can exploit any vulnerability in the kernel implementation. Even a single bug in the kernel can leave the system vulnerable. Keeping your system current with the latest patches provides some level of defense, but it is still inadvisable to download and install untrusted software off the web. </P>
<P>In the future, we are likely to see three complementary trends: </P>

<LI class=itemize>
<P><B>Operating system support for fine-grained protection.</B> Process isolation is becoming more flexible and fine-grained in order to reflect different levels of trust in different applications. Today, it is typical for a user application to have the permissions of that user. This allows a virus masquerading as a screen saver to steal or corrupt that user&#8217;s data without needing to compromise the operating system first. Smartphone operating systems have started to add better controls to prevent certain applications without a &#8220;need to know&#8221; from accessing sensitive information, such as the smartphone&#8217;s location or the list of frequently called telephone numbers. </P>
<LI class=itemize>
<P><B>Application-layer sandboxing.</B> Increasingly, many applications are becoming mini-operating systems in their own right, capable of safely executing third-party software to extend and improve the user experience. Sophisticated scripts customize web site behavior; web browsers must efficiently and completely isolate these scripts so that they cannot steal the user&#8217;s data or corrupt the browser. Other applications &#8212; such as databases and desktop publishing systems &#8212; are also moving in the direction of needing application-layer sandboxing. Google&#8217;s Native Client and Microsoft&#8217;s Application Domains are two example systems that provide general-purpose, safe execution of third-party code at the user level. </P>
<LI class=itemize>
<P><B>Hardware support for virtualization.</B> Virtual machines provide an extra layer of protection beneath the operating system. Even if a malicious process run by a guest operating system on a virtual machine were able to corrupt the kernel, its impact would be limited to just that virtual machine. Below the virtual machine interface, the host operating system needs to provide isolation between different virtual machines; this is much easier in practice because the virtual machine interface is much simpler than the kernel&#8217;s system call interface. For example, in a data center, virtual machines provide users with the flexibility to run any application without compromising data center operation. </P>
<P>Computer manufacturers are re-designing processor architectures to reduce the cost of running a virtual machine. For example, on some new processors, guest operating systems can directly handle their own interrupts, processor exceptions, and system calls without those events needing to be mediated by the host operating system. Likewise, I/O device manufacturers are re-designing their interfaces to do direct transfers to and from the guest operating system without the need to go through the host kernel. </P></LI></UL>
