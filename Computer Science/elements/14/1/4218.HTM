<SPAN>A modem (which comes from modulator/demodulator) is a device that originally took the digital signals from a computer and enabled them to be sent over a voice line where a modem on the other side changed them back to digital signals. But people call the device that hooks their local network to their ISP a modem even when no voice line is involved. ie a cable modem.</SPAN>
