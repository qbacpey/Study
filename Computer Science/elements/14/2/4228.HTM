When you give someone a good, long look, you regard them. It can also mean "to believe," as in "I regard her as my best friend."</P>
<P>Regardoften means respect and admiration, as in "I have the greatest regardfor my grandmother." Sometimes it's a greeting: you can send someone your regards, which means to tell them you said hello and wish them well. There's a famous song called, "Give My Regards to Broadway." On the other hand, you can use it as a sign-off on a letter. Instead of "Sincerely" or "Yours Truly," you can close with "Regards."
