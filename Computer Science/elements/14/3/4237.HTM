Anything diagnostich as to do with disease, especially figuring out which one a patient has.</P>
<P>If your doctor wants to run diagnostic tests, then she isn't exactly sure what's wrong with you &#8212; so the tests will help diagnoseyou (figure out what's wrong). The TV show House is all about diagnostic tests: it features illnesses that are unusual and hard to determine. But anything diagnostic is trying to figure out what's wrong. A writing test could be called diagnostic if it's trying to determine how good or bad your writing skills are.
