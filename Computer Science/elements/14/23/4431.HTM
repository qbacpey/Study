In practice, the operating system will often create a thread to run blockzero in the background. The memory of an exiting process does not need to be cleared until the memory is needed &#8212; that is, when the next process is created. 
<P></P>
<P>To exploit this flexibility, the operating system can create a set of low priority threads to run blockzero. The kernel can then return immediately and resume running application code. Later on, when the memory is needed, the kernel can call thread_join. If the zero is complete by that point, the join will return immediately; otherwise, it will wait until the memory is safe to use.</P>
