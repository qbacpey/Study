<STRONG>Question</STRONG> 
<P></P>
<P>Could you please explain how to use &#8220;be + to + verb," as in the sentence below? &#8211;Elihu, Mexico 
<P>We are to get a wage raise in May. 
<P><STRONG>Answer</STRONG> 
<P>The construction &#8220;be + to + verb&#8221; is a formal construction that is used either a) to give an instruction or command, or b) to tell what is going to happen in the future. </P><SPAN class=extract>
<P>In the following three sentences, the &#8220;be + to + verb&#8221; construction signals that these are commands. This construction makes the sentences sound serious and formal. 
<P>You are to do your homework without watching any TV. 
<P>The students are not to travel by subway without a friend. 
<P>[Patient speaking to nurse] The doctor says that I&#8217;m to make an appointment to come back next month. </P>
<P></SPAN><SPAN class=extract>&nbsp; 
<P>In the following sentences, the &#8220;be + to + verb&#8221; construction tells us that these sentences are about planned or scheduled events. 
<P>The plane is to take off at 9pm. 
<P>The new kitchen cabinets are to arrive before December 20th. 
<P>Their house is to be sold right away.</P>
<P></SPAN>&nbsp; 
<P>Again, these sentences sound formal. If we change the verb construction to &#8220;be + going + to + verb,&#8221; they retain the same meaning but sound less formal. 
<P>The plane is going to take off at 9am. 
<P>The new kitchen cabinets are going to arrive before December 20th. 
<P>Their house is to going to be sold right away. 
<P>I hope this helps.
