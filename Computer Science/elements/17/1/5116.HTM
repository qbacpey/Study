Even once operating system support for threads became widespread, pure user-level threads were sometimes used to minimize dependencies on specific operating systems and to maximize portability; for example, the earliest implementations of Sun&#8217;s Java Virtual Machine (JVM) implemented what were called <EM><A data-9uzdtcnnj6xqoalwmdp3qa='{"name": "OEBPS/Text/part0000.xhtml", "frag": "glo:green threads"}'>green threads</A></EM>, a pure user-level implementation of threads. 
<P>The basic idea is simple. The thread library instantiates all of its data structures within the process: TCBs, the ready list, the finished list, and the waiting lists all are just data structures in the process&#8217;s address space. Then, calls to the thread library are just procedure calls, akin to how the same functions are implemented within a multi-threaded kernel.
