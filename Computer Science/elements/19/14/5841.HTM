<P><SPAN class=extract>A crowd of people might gather for a party, concert, or demonstration, with the word crowd implying that there's something a little disorderly &#8212; noisy or unruly &#8212; about the group.</SPAN> <SPAN class=extract>Crowd can also mean "the mass of ordinary people," which is the way you're using the word when you say you want to "stand out from the crowd." You want to be seen as a distinct, individual person, rather than part of a larger mass of regular folks.</SPAN>
