In Project Userprog, a page fault in a user process leads to the termination of the process. You should expect those page faults to occur in the robustness tests where we test that your kernel properly termi- nates processes that try to access invalid addresses. To debug those, set a breakpoint in page_fault in exception.c, which you will need to modify accordingly.</P>
