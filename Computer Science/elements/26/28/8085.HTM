The aim is to share a scarce resource. For example, in telecommunications, several<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title="Telephone call" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_call">telephone calls</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>may be carried using one wire. Multiplexing originated in<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing#Telegraphy">telegraphy</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>in the 1870s, and is now widely applied in communications. In<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing#Telephony">telephony</A>,<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title="George Owen Squier" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Owen_Squier">George Owen Squier</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>is credited with the development of telephone carrier multiplexing in 1910.</P>
<P>The multiplexed signal is transmitted over a communication channel such as a cable. The multiplexing divides the capacity of the communication channel into several logical channels, one for each message signal or data stream to be transferred. A reverse process, known as demultiplexing, extracts the original channels on the receiver end.</P>
<P>A device that performs the multiplexing is called a<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title=Multiplexer href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexer">multiplexer</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>(MUX), and a device that performs the reverse process is called a<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title=Demultiplexer class=mw-redirect href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demultiplexer">demultiplexer</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>(DEMUX or DMX).</P>
<P><A title="Inverse multiplexing" class=mw-redirect href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_multiplexing">Inverse multiplexing</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>(IMUX) has the opposite aim as multiplexing, namely to break one data stream into several streams, transfer them simultaneously over several communication channels, and recreate the original data stream.</P>
