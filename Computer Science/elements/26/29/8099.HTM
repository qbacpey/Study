A curriculum is a set of courses designed to give expertise, like the shoemaking curriculumat Shoe U: Advanced Cutting, Hammering, and Stitching; History of the Heel; and A Cultural History of Walking.</P>
<P>Curriculum comes from the Latin word for "running course," or "career," but when we talk about curriculumit's always about school. If you go to a school with a Liberal Arts curriculum, you'll get an education in the humanities with some science, but if you go to a technical school with a hard-core astrophysics curriculum, you probably won't have to take any courses on poetry.
