A council is a group of people that gathers for the purpose of giving advice or making decisions. If you&#8217;re president of the student council, for example, you might organize people to get the hallways at your school painted purple.</P>
<P>Council comes from the Latin word conciliumfor "group of people, meeting," which is what it basically means today. There are student councils, honor councils, or city councils, to name a few. People working together to take care of business &#8212; that&#8217;s a council. Of course, that council might give advice, or counsel (with an s) people on what to do. Not the same word &#8212; an honor council might counsel a principal about how to address cheating in school, for example.
