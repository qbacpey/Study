<P>There are two ways of categorizing VLAN enabled ports on network devices:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Untagged or Native ports 
<LI>Tagged or Trunk ports</LI></UL>
<P><EM><SPAN class=extract><EM>A network port is a communication endpoint a device uses to send and receive traffic.</EM></SPAN></EM></P>
<P><STRONG><SPAN class=extract><STRONG>Native ports accept traffic from a single VLAN and are used to link end devices like routers, servers, terminals etc.</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>They do not need to accommodate an additional identification tag as they are involved in exchanging traffic with a single end device. Hence the name,<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>untagged ports</STRONG>. They are also referred to as<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>access ports.</STRONG></SPAN></STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG><SPAN class=extract><STRONG>Trunk ports are used to pass traffic from multiple VLANs and are used to link switches.</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>In order to distinguish between frames from different VLANs, trunk ports add identification tags to the frames. Hence the name,<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>tagged ports.</STRONG></SPAN></STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG><SPAN class=extract></P>
<P><STRONG>A trunk is a point-to-point link between two network devices that carry more than one VLAN.</STRONG></P>

<P>In the diagram above, devices 1 and 2 have established Native VLANs with Switch 1. Similarly, devices 3 and 4 have Native VLANs established with Switch 2. <SPAN class=extract>Note that native VLANs transport untagged frames.</SPAN> <SPAN class=extract>However, when these untagged frames reach a trunk end, they need to be tagged to make sure the switch on the other side of the trunk can forward the frames to the right destinations. As a result, the switches with trunk ports add tags to the frames for identification - a process typically known as VLAN Encapsulation.</SPAN><SPAN class=extract>Switch 1 tags all frames it receives from device 1 with VLAN ID 1 because device 1 belongs to VLAN 1, before forwarding the frames on the trunk. Similarly, it tags all frames from device 2 with VLAN ID 2. Switch 2, on receiving the tagged frames, decapsulates them to check which VLAN they are destined for and forwards them accordingly.</SPAN> <SPAN class=extract>Traffic on VLAN 1 will not be seen by devices in VLAN2 because Layer 2 unicast, multicast and broadcast traffic will not cross VLAN boundaries.<BR></SPAN>
