<B>EXAMPLE: </B>Why might the &#8220;Hello&#8221; message from thread 2 print <EM>after</EM> the &#8220;Hello&#8221; message for thread 5, even though thread 2 was created before thread 5? 
<P></P>
<P><B>ANSWER: </B><B>Creating and scheduling threads are separate operations.</B> Although threads are usually scheduled in the order that they are created, there is no guarantee. Further, even if thread 2 started running before thread 5, it might be preempted before it reaches the printf call. </P>
<P>Rather, the only assumption the programmer can make is that each of the threads runs on its own virtual processor with unpredictable speed. Any interleaving is possible. &#9633;</P>
