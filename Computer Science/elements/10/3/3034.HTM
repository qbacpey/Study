<H3>Static and Dynamic Binding</H3>
<P><EM>Binding</EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>refers to the association of names in program text to the storage locations to which they refer.</P>

<P>&nbsp;In<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>static binding</EM>, this association is predetermined at build time. With<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>dynamic binding</EM>, this association is not determined until run-time.</P>

<P>Truly static binding is almost extinct. Earlier assemblers and FORTRAN, for example, would completely precompute the exact memory location of all variables and subroutine locations. This situation did not last long, with the introduction of stack and heap allocation for variables and dynamically-loaded libraries for subroutines.</P>
<P>&#22534;&#26632;&#21644;&#21160;&#24577;&#21152;&#36733;&#24211;&#30340;&#24341;&#20837;&#21487;&#33021;&#21644;&#21160;&#24577;&#32465;&#23450;&#30340;&#24191;&#27867;&#25512;&#34892;&#26377;&#25152;&#20851;&#32852;</P>
<P>So one must take some liberty with the definitions. It is the spirit of the concept that counts here: statically bound programs precompute as much as possible about storage layout as is practical in a modern virtual memory, garbage collected, separately compiled application. Dynamically bound programs wait as late as possible.</P>
<P>An example might help. If I attempt to invoke a method<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><CODE><FONT face="Courier New">MyClass.foo()</FONT></CODE>, a static-binding system will verify at build time that there is a class called<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><CODE><FONT face="Courier New">MyClass</FONT></CODE><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>and that class has a method called<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><CODE><FONT face="Courier New">foo</FONT></CODE>. A dynamic-binding system will wait until run-time to see whether either exists.
