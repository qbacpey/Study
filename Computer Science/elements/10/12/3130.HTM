<P><SPAN class=extract>If you are going to start a sentence with &#8220;rather,&#8221; it is common to use a comma after it. Using &#8220;rather&#8221; in this way transforms the word to its conjunctive adverb&#65288;&#36830;&#25509;&#21103;&#35789;&#65289; form, where you can use it to suggest the opposite idea of the sentence before it</SPAN>.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Examples:&nbsp;</P><EM><SPAN class=extract>
<P><EM>Tommy had no interest in becoming a professional basketball player.<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></EM><STRONG><EM>Rather,</EM></STRONG><EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>his love for food drove him to become a professional chef.</EM></P></SPAN></EM>
<P><EM>Katherin&#8217;s puppy hated going for walks on rainy days.<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></EM><STRONG><EM>Rather,</EM></STRONG><EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>it preferred a long walk when it was sunny outside.</EM></P>
<P><EM>The sky wasn&#8217;t blue that day.<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></EM><STRONG><EM>Rather,</EM></STRONG><EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>it was dark grey with thick clouds that foretold the coming of a thunderstorm.</EM></P>
<P>In these examples, &#8220;rather&#8221; functions to coordinate the explanation of<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>what is</EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>regarding the subject in the sentence<EM>,</EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>while the sentence before establishes<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><EM>what is not</EM><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>regarding that same subject.</P>
