If you're looking for an adjective that means "sticking out above the rest; famous," consider prominent. A prominentperson might be the big cheese, the head honcho, the top dog &#8212; not just any Joe Schmo.</P>
<P>A prominenceis anything that juts out, like a bone or a mountain ridge. Prominent, then, means "sticking out" either in a literal sense ("a prominent nose") or a figurative one ("a prominent figure in the industry"). The metaphorical sense of "famous" is the most common one today, though references to the "prominentposterior" of Jennifer Lopez might fit both definitions.
