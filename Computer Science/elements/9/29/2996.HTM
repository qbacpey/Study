<SPAN class=extract>When something evolves, it changes, or develops over time, like your taste in music and clothes, which evolveas you get older</SPAN>.

<P>Evolve comes from the Latin word &#275;volvere, "to unroll," the perfect image to keep in mind when thinking of this verb. When something is unrolling or unraveling, it is doing so gradually, not all at once. Evolve describes a development that is taking its time to reach its final destination. Think change with a speed limit. Your taste in music evolved from the nursery rhymes you loved as a little kid to whatever you like today. <SPAN class=extract>Even places can evolve, like the old-fashioned coffee shops that evolved into Internet cafes as people began to bring their laptops with them</SPAN>.
