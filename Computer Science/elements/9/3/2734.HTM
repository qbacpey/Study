<H3 id=you-can-use-rather-as-a-predeterminer-to-determine-the-degree>You Can Use &#8220;Rather&#8221; as a Predeterminer to Determine the Degree</H3>
<P>If you place &#8220;rather&#8221; in front of a plain form adverb and put an &#8220;a&#8221; between them, you can use &#8220;rather&#8221; as a predeterminer to convey the degree of the description you are writing.</P>
<P>Examples:</P>
<P>That was<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>rather a good</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>book I read over the holiday. It was a murder mystery with a surprising end.</P>
<P>There was<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>rather a sad</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>song on the radio this morning while driving into work. I admit I shed a tear or two.</P>
<P>It was<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>rather a busy</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>day in the office today. We have a major deadline tomorrow morning.</P>
<P>In these examples, notice that the degree is higher than normal. <SPAN class=extract>You can say you read a good book, but saying you read &#8220;rather a good&#8221; book indicates that this book was, to a degree, better than most of the other books you usually read.<BR></SPAN>
