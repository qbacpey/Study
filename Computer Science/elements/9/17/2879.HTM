Notice that when you use &#8220;rather than&#8221; as a prepositional phrase, the verb that follows &#8220;rather than&#8221; is almost always in -ing form (when it doesn&#8217;t take the plain form), whereas the verb that contrasts in the latter part of the sentence is usually in the past tense.&nbsp;</P>
