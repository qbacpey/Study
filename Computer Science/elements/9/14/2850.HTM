<SPAN>As to the last specifier in your cases:</SPAN> 
<P><SPAN>x/12x has none, so <SPAN class=extract>gdb defaults to assuming you want 4-byte chunks (which GDB calls "words", x86 calls "double words").</SPAN> Generally, I'd always specify what exactly you want as opposed to falling back on default settings</SPAN></P><SPAN>
<P>x/8xw does the same, for 8 objects, as you explicitly requested dwords now.</P>
<P>(<SPAN class=extract>The<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><CODE><FONT face="Courier New">x</FONT></CODE><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>command defaults to the last size you used, but the initial default for that on startup is<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><CODE><FONT face="Courier New">w</FONT></CODE><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>words</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN>x/8xh requests half-word sized chunks of 2 bytes, so objects printed in 2 byte chunks. (Half-word relative to GDB's standard 32-bit word size; x86 calls this a "word").</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN class=extract><SPAN><SPAN>In case you wonder why the concatenation of two neighboring values does not equal what was reported when you printed in dwords, this is because the x86 is a little-endian architecture.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN> What that means is detailed quite well in Erickson's book again - if you look a few pages ahead, he does some calculations you might find helpful. In a nutshell, if you recombine them (2,1) (4,3), ..., you'll see they match.</SPAN></SPAN></P><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN class=extract>
<P><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>Not quite -- the default is "words" -- 4 byte objects -- not "double words" -- 8 byte objects.<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN><CODE><FONT face="Courier New">x/8xw</FONT></CODE><SPAN><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>prints words (4 bytes objects) explicitly. You need<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN><CODE><FONT face="Courier New">g</FONT></CODE><SPAN><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>on the end for 8 byte objects.</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN><SPAN><SPAN>terminology within gdb is word (hence the w). <SPAN class=extract>Within intel x86 (and the book op is reading) it's dword for 4 bytes</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P></SPAN>
