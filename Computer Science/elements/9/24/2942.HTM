<P>You often hear of a species being extinct: there are no living representatives of the species left. </P><SPAN class=extract>
<P>But extinct also describes something that has gone out or grown cold, as in a dormant volcano "extinct volcano" or a tobacco pipe whose flame has died out "extinct pipe." That&#8217;s because extinct comes from the Latin extinguere/exstinguerefor "extinguish." Originally extinct referred to fires that died out (were extinguished). Its meaning grew to encompass a family line and then a species.</P></SPAN>
