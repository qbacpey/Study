<SPAN class=extract>Think of an interface as a "face-to-face," a place where things, or people, or people and things (like you and your computer) meet. Any common boundary or area of convergence can be an interface.</SPAN> 
<P></P>
<P><SPAN class=extract>Used as a verb, interface means to merge or mingle, bonding and synthesizing by communicating and working together.</SPAN> The word interface is comprised of the prefix inter, which means "between," and face. In the 1960's, when computers first began to be commonly used, the word became familiar and now can simply mean &#8220;to meet.&#8221; Although "Shall we interface over coffee?" still feels a bit awkward.
