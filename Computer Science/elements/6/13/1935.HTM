This chapter describes the object file information and system actions that create running programs. <SPAN class=extract>Executable and shared object files statically represent programs. To execute such programs, the system uses the files to create dynamic program representations, or process images</SPAN>.&nbsp; A process image has segments that hold its text, data, stack, and so on. This section describes the program header and complements Chapter 1, by describing object file structures that relate directly to program execution. The primary data structure, a program header table, locates segment images within the file and contains other information necessary to create the memory image for the program. 
<P><SPAN class=extract>&nbsp; 
<P>Given an object file, the system must load it into memory for the program to run.&nbsp; After the system loads the program, it must complete the process image by resolving symbolic references among the object files that compose the process.</P></SPAN>
