<P><SPAN class=extract>Standard DMA, also called third-party DMA, uses a DMA controller</SPAN>. <SPAN class=extract>A DMA controller can generate<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title="Memory address" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_address">memory addresses</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>and initiate memory read or write cycles</SPAN>. <SPAN class=extract>A DMA controller contains several<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title="Hardware register" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_register">hardware registers</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>that can be written and read by the CPU. These include a memory address register, a byte count register, and one or more control registers</SPAN>. <SPAN class=extract>Depending on what features the DMA controller provides, these control registers might specify some combination of the source, the destination, the direction of the transfer (reading from the I/O device or writing to the I/O device), the size of the transfer unit, and/or the number of bytes to transfer in one burst</SPAN>.<SUP id=cite_ref-Osborne80_1-0 class=reference><A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_memory_access#cite_note-Osborne80-1">[1]</A></SUP></P>

<P><SPAN class=extract>To carry out an input, output or memory-to-memory operation, the host processor initializes the DMA controller with a count of the number of<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title="Word (computer architecture)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_(computer_architecture)">words</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>to transfer, and the memory address to use. The CPU then commands the peripheral device to initiate a data transfer. The DMA controller then provides addresses and read/write control lines to the system memory. Each time a byte of data is ready to be transferred between the peripheral device and memory, the DMA controller increments its internal address register until the full block<BR></SPAN>
