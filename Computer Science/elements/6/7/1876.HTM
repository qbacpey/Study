<P><SPAN class=extract>You can use &#8220;rather&#8221; as an adverb to determine the degree of a word. You can do this by placing &#8220;rather&#8221; just before an adjective or another adverb to convey how much &#8212; usually a soft indication of something being too much &#8212; something is</SPAN>.&nbsp;</P>
<P>Examples:</P>
<UL>

<LI>This kitchen is<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><STRONG>rather</STRONG><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>dark, don&#8217;t you think? There are no windows to let in the sunlight.</LI></UL>
<P>&#8220;Rather&#8221; can determine the degree of an adverb when you will place it directly in front of the adverb and add a &#8220;ly&#8221; onto the word.&nbsp;</P>
