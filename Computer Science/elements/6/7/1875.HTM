<B>Reliability.</B> Improved reliability is another reason to keep the operating system kernel minimal. Kernel code needs the power to set up hardware devices, such as the disk, and to control protection boundaries between applications. <SPAN class=extract>However, kernel modules are typically not protected from one another, and so a bug in kernel code (whether sensitive or not) may corrupt user or kernel data. This has led some systems to use a philosophy of &#8220;what can be at user level, should be.&#8221;</SPAN> <SPAN class=extract>An extreme version of approach is to isolate privileged, but less critical, parts of the operating system such as the file system or the window system, from the rest of the kernel. This is called a <EM><A data-ixbpernmnjoud4qz9ktzkg='{"name": "OEBPS/Text/part0000.xhtml", "frag": "glo:microkernel"}'>microkernel</A></EM> design. In a microkernel, the kernel itself is kept small, and instead most of the functionality of a traditional operating system kernel is put into a set of user-level processes, or servers, accessed from user applications via interprocess communication</SPAN>
