<P><SPAN class=extract>The<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><B>FLAGS</B><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title="Processor register" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_register">register</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>is the<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title="Status register" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_register">status register</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>that contains the current state of a<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title=CPU class=mw-redirect href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU">CPU</A></SPAN>. <SPAN class=extract>The size and meanings of the flag bits are architecture dependent</SPAN>. <SPAN class=extract>It usually reflects the result of arithmetic operations as well as information about restrictions placed on the CPU operation at the current time. Some of those restrictions may include preventing some interrupts from triggering, prohibition of execution of a class of "privileged" instructions</SPAN>. Additional status flags may bypass memory mapping and define what action the CPU should take on arithmetic overflow.</P>
<P></P>
<P><SPAN class=extract>The carry, parity, adjust, zero and sign flags are included in many architectures</SPAN>. The adjust flag used to be called auxiliary carry bit in 8080 and half-carry bit in the<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title="Zilog Z80" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80">Zilog Z80</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>architecture.</P>
<P>In<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title=I386 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I386">i386</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>architecture the register is<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title=16-bit class=mw-redirect href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16-bit">16&nbsp;bits</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>wide. Its successors, the<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><B>EFLAGS</B><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>and<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><B>RFLAGS</B><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>registers, are<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title=32-bit class=mw-redirect href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/32-bit">32&nbsp;bits</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>and<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title=64-bit class=mw-redirect href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64-bit">64&nbsp;bits</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>wide, respectively. The wider registers retain compatibility with their smaller predecessors.</P>
<P><SPAN class=extract>All FLAGS registers contain the<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title="Condition code register" class=mw-redirect href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condition_code_register">condition codes</A>, flag bits that let the results of one<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title="Machine language" class=mw-redirect href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_language">machine-language</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>instruction affect another instruction</SPAN>. <SPAN class=extract>Arithmetic and logical instructions set some or all of the flags, and conditional jump instructions take variable action based on the value of certain flags. For example,<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><CODE><FONT face="Courier New">jz</FONT></CODE><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>(Jump if Zero),<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><CODE><FONT face="Courier New">jc</FONT></CODE><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>(Jump if Carry), and<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><CODE><FONT face="Courier New">jo</FONT></CODE><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>(Jump if Overflow) depend on specific flags. Other conditional jumps test combinations of several flags</SPAN>.</P>
<P><SPAN class=extract>FLAGS registers can be moved from or to the stack</SPAN>. This is part of the job of saving and restoring CPU context, against a routine such as an interrupt service routine whose changes to registers should not be seen by the calling code. Here are the relevant instructions:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The PUSHF and POPF instructions transfer the 16-bit FLAGS register. 
<LI>PUSHFD/POPFD (introduced with the<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title=I386 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I386">i386</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>architecture) transfer the 32-bit double register EFLAGS. 
<LI>PUSHFQ/POPFQ (introduced with the<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title=X64 class=mw-redirect href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X64">x64</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>architecture) transfer the 64-bit quadword register RFLAGS.</LI></UL>
<P>In 64-bit mode, PUSHF/POPF and PUSHFQ/POPFQ are available but PUSHFD/POPFD are not.<SUP id=cite_ref-4 class=reference><A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAGS_register#cite_note-4">[4]</A></SUP><SUP class="reference nowrap"><SPAN title="Page / location: 4&#8211;349, 4&#8211;432">:&#8202;4&#8211;349,&#8202;4&#8211;432&#8202;</SPAN></SUP></P>
<P>The lower 8 bits of the FLAGS register is also open to direct load/store manipulation by SAHF and LAHF (load/store AH into flags).
