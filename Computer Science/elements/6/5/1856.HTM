Note that<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><TT class="docutils literal"><SPAN class=pre>array_place</SPAN></TT><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>is simply a label (or an alias) to the memory address 0x417000. Therefore accessing<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><TT class="docutils literal"><SPAN class=pre>array_place[7]</SPAN></TT><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>is simply accessing memory address 0x417007. Therefore, as we can see in the disassembly, the compiler just replaces<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><TT class="docutils literal"><SPAN class=pre>array_place[7]</SPAN></TT><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>by 0x417007 - no address computation has to be done by the assembly it generates
