<P><SPAN class=extract>A symbol can be neither local or global for a variety of reasons, e.g., because it is used for debugging, but it is probably an indication of a bug if it is ever both local and global</SPAN>. <SPAN class=extract>Unique global symbols are a GNU extension to the standard set of ELF symbol bindings.&nbsp; For such a symbol&nbsp;the dynamic linker will make sure that in the entire process there is just one symbol with this name and&nbsp;type in use</SPAN>
