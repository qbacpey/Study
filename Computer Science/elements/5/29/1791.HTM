<B><SPAN class=extract><B>Direct memory access</B><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>(<B>DMA</B>) is a feature of computer systems that allows certain hardware subsystems to access main system<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title="Computer memory" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_memory">memory</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>independently of the<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title="Central processing unit" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit">central processing unit</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>(CPU). </SPAN></B>

<P>Without DMA, when the CPU is using<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title="Programmed input/output" class=mw-redirect href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_input/output">programmed input/output</A>, it is typically fully occupied for the entire duration of the read or write operation, and is thus unavailable to perform other work. <SPAN class=extract>With DMA, the CPU first initiates the transfer, then it does other operations while the transfer is in progress, and it finally receives an<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title=Interrupt href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt">interrupt</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>from the DMA controller (DMAC) when the operation is done</SPAN>. This feature is useful at any time that the CPU cannot keep up with the rate of data transfer, or when the CPU needs to perform work while waiting for a relatively slow I/O data transfer. Many hardware systems use DMA, including<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title="Disk storage" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_storage">disk drive</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>controllers,<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title="Video card" class=mw-redirect href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_card">graphics cards</A>,<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title="Network interface controller" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_interface_controller">network cards</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>and<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title="Sound card" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_card">sound cards</A>. DMA is also used for intra-chip data transfer in<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title="Multi-core processor" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor">multi-core processors</A>. Computers that have DMA channels can transfer data to and from devices with much less CPU overhead than computers without DMA channels. Similarly, a<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title="Processing element" class=mw-redirect href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing_element">processing element</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>inside a multi-core processor can transfer data to and from its local memory without occupying its processor time, allowing computation and data transfer to proceed in parallel.</P>
<P>DMA can also be used for "memory to memory" copying or moving of data within memory. DMA can offload expensive memory operations, such as large copies or<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title="Vectored I/O" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vectored_I/O">scatter-gather</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>operations, from the CPU to a dedicated DMA engine. An implementation example is the<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title="I/O Acceleration Technology" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I/O_Acceleration_Technology">I/O Acceleration Technology</A>. DMA is of interest in<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title="Network on a chip" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_on_a_chip">network-on-chip</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>and<SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><A title="In-memory processing" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-memory_processing">in-memory computing</A><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>architectures.
