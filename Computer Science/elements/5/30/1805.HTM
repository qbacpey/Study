<SPAN class=clozed>Prevail</SPAN> can be used for different kinds of success. If you prevail upon someone, you have influence on them. If you prevail over someone, you win. Say you&#8217;re a big fan of a losing team. You might cheer, &#8220;Despite all odds, we will prevail!&#8221; To use prevail, there has to be some kind of contest or conflict. That could be internal, like when you have a pile of homework to do, but your desire to play video games prevails over your discipline.
