<B>Entering the handler.</B> When an interrupt or exception occurs, if the processor detects that it is already in kernel mode (by inspecting the eflags register), it just pushes the instruction pointer and eflags registers (but not the stack pointer) onto the existing stack. On the other hand, if the hardware detects that it is switching from user-mode to kernel-mode, then the processor also changes the stack pointer to the base of the interrupt stack and pushes the original stack pointer along with the instruction pointer and eflags registers onto the new stack.
